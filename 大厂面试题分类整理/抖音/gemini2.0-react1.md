Based on the search results, here's a compilation of React interview questions, focusing on those relevant to Douyin (Bytedance) front-end development roles, and avoiding repetition from previous questions that might have been asked:

Here's a breakdown of potential React interview questions, drawing from the search snippets, and organized for clarity:

**React Concepts & Fundamentals (Beyond the Very Basics)**

*   **Immutability in React:**
    *   What is the concept of "immutable data structures" emphasized in React, and how is it implemented? (Source: *free-resources/INTERVIEW.md at master*)
    *   Why is immutability important in the context of React's rendering and performance?

*   **Vue vs. React:**
    *   What are the differences between Vue (specifically Vue 2) and React? (Source: *前端面经真题与解析1:字节/抖音/实习原创*)  This question tests comparative knowledge. While you're focused on React, understanding the differences demonstrates broader front-end awareness.  The search snippet mentions they share the use of Virtual DOM.  Expand on other similarities *and* differences, such as:
        *   Data binding (one-way vs. two-way)
        *   Component architecture (single-file components vs. JSX)
        *   Ecosystem and community differences
        *   Templating vs. JSX

* **General Interview Question Types**
    *Describe parameter reuse, advance confirmation, and lazy execution in the context of function design.(Source: *前端面经真题与解析3:字节/抖音/实习(2万字长文） 原创*)
    *Explain what is function currying and give an example.(Source: *前端面经真题与解析3:字节/抖音/实习(2万字长文） 原创*)

**Broader Front-End Knowledge (Relevant to React Development)**

*   **General Front-End Interview Questions:** The search results highlight that Douyin/Bytedance interviews cover a wide range of front-end topics, not just React. Be prepared for questions on:
    *   HTML and CSS (Source: *前端面试题html和css*)
    *   JavaScript (fundamental JS questions are very common)
    *   HTTP and TCP (Source: *前端面试题html和css*)
    *   Algorithms (Source: *前端面试题html和css*)
    *   Computer Networks (Source: *前端面试题html和css*)
    *Must-know front-end JS libraries, especially React.(Source: *react学习*)

**Important Considerations for Douyin/Bytedance Interviews:**

*   **Real-World Experience:** The snippets suggest focusing on practical application and "real interview questions" (*真题*). Be ready to discuss projects you've worked on, challenges you've faced, and how you've used React to solve specific problems.
*   **Comprehensive Preparation:**  The snippets mention resources like GitHub repositories with extensive question lists. It's clear that a broad and deep understanding of front-end concepts is expected.
*  **Bytedance/Douyin Specific:** While the snippets don't give *exact* Douyin-specific React questions, they strongly suggest that you should research Bytedance/Douyin's tech stack and the types of products they build. This will help you anticipate the kinds of React challenges they might present. For example, consider how React might be used in:
    *   Short-form video applications (like Douyin/TikTok)
    *   High-performance, interactive user interfaces
    *   Large-scale applications with many components

Key takeaway: The interview will likely involve a mix of conceptual questions, coding challenges, and discussions of your past projects, all within the broader context of front-end development. Preparing for a wide range of front-end topics, in addition to core React concepts, is crucial.
