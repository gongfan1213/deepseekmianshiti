Okay, based on the provided search results, here's a compilation of ByteDance (TikTok/Douyin) front-end interview coding questions, focusing on those that require on-site handwritten code, avoiding repetition from previous answers, and aiming for a comprehensive list:

**Key Areas and Example Problems (with Code Snippets when applicable):**

The search snippets highlight that ByteDance interviews, particularly for Douyin/TikTok, cover these areas, with a strong emphasis on practical coding ability:

1.  **JavaScript Fundamentals & Core Concepts:**

    *   **`this` keyword:** Understanding `this` binding in various contexts (as mentioned in one of the snippets).  This is a very common interview topic.

    *   **Prototype Chain:**  Snippet 2 mentions a "prototype chain output question," indicating the importance of understanding prototype-based inheritance.  Expect questions like:
        *   "Explain the prototype chain in JavaScript."
        *   "Implement inheritance using prototypes."
        *   "What is the difference between `__proto__` and `prototype`?"

    *   **Event Loop & Asynchronous Programming:** Snippet 2 mentions an "event loop, output question."  This is crucial.  Expect questions involving `setTimeout`, `Promise`, and `async/await`.  Be prepared to predict the output of code snippets and explain the order of execution. Example question (new, not repeating previous ones):
        ```javascript
          console.log('1');

          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('2');
            Promise.resolve().then(() => {
              console.log('3');
            });
          }, 0);

          new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            console.log('4');
            resolve();
          }).then(() => {
            console.log('5');
            setTimeout(() => { console.log('6')},0)
          });
          console.log('7')
        ```
        *   **Expected Output & Explanation:**  The output will be `1`, `4`, `7`, `5`, `2`, `3`, `6`.  A detailed explanation, breaking down the synchronous code, microtasks (Promise.then), and macrotasks (setTimeout) is essential.

    * **Closures:** Expect questions that test your understanding of closures, how they work, and their practical applications (e.g., creating private variables, currying).

    *   **Data Types:**  Snippet 2 explicitly mentions "basic data types."  Be prepared for questions about primitive vs. reference types, type coercion, and type checking.

2.  **Algorithms and Data Structures:**  This is a major focus area, evident from multiple snippets.

    *   **Array Manipulation:**
        *   **Flattening a Multidimensional Array:** Snippet 4 and 7 mention "array flattening."  This is a classic.  Be prepared to implement this recursively and iteratively.
            ```javascript
            // Recursive
            function flattenRecursive(arr) {
              let result = [];
              for (let item of arr) {
                if (Array.isArray(item)) {
                  result = result.concat(flattenRecursive(item));
                } else {
                  result.push(item);
                }
              }
              return result;
            }

            // Iterative (using a stack)
            function flattenIterative(arr) {
              const stack = [...arr];
              const result = [];
              while (stack.length) {
                const next = stack.pop();
                if (Array.isArray(next)) {
                  stack.push(...next); // Push elements back onto the stack
                } else {
                  result.push(next);
                }
              }
              return result.reverse(); // Reverse to maintain original order
            }
            ```
        * **Object Flattening:** Snippet 7 mentions "object flattening."
           ```javascript
           function flattenObject(obj, prefix = '', result = {}) {
              for (const key in obj) {
                if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                  const newKey = prefix ? `${prefix}.${key}` : key;
                  if (typeof obj[key] === 'object' && obj[key] !== null && !Array.isArray(obj[key])) {
                    flattenObject(obj[key], newKey, result);
                  } else {
                    result[newKey] = obj[key];
                  }
                }
              }
              return result;
            }
           ```

    *   **Tree Traversal:** Snippet 7 specifically mentions "depth-first traversal of a binary tree, using both recursive and non-recursive methods." This is a very likely candidate.
        ```javascript
        // Assuming a Node structure like:
        // class Node {
        //   constructor(value) {
        //     this.value = value;
        //     this.left = null;
        //     this.right = null;
        //   }
        // }

        // Recursive Depth-First Traversal (Pre-order)
        function dfsRecursive(node) {
          if (!node) return;
          console.log(node.value); // Process the node
          dfsRecursive(node.left);
          dfsRecursive(node.right);
        }

        // Iterative Depth-First Traversal (Pre-order using a stack)
        function dfsIterative(root) {
          if (!root) return;
          const stack = [root];
          while (stack.length) {
            const node = stack.pop();
            console.log(node.value); // Process the node
            if (node.right) stack.push(node.right); // Push right first (LIFO)
            if (node.left) stack.push(node.left);
          }
        }
        ```

    *   **Linked List Reversal:** Snippet 7 mentions "reversing a linked list, reversing every k elements."  This is a classic interview question, testing your understanding of pointers and linked list manipulation.
        ```javascript
          //Assuming a Node Structure:
          // class Node{
          //   constructor(val){
          //     this.val = val;
          //     this.next = null;
          //   }
          // }

          function reverseLinkedList(head){
            let prev = null;
            let current = head;
            let next = null;

            while(current != null){
              next = current.next; //save next
              current.next = prev; //reverse
              prev = current;
              current = next;
            }
            return prev;
          }
        ```
    * **Other Algorithms:** Be prepared for common algorithm questions like:
        *   Searching (binary search).
        *   Sorting (quick sort, merge sort - understand the time and space complexity).
        *   Dynamic Programming (though less likely for front-end, basic problems like Fibonacci sequence could appear).

3.  **Coding Style & Best Practices:**

    *   **Deep Copy:** Snippet 2 mentions "handwriting a deep copy." This tests your understanding of object cloning and handling nested objects and arrays.
    ```javascript
      function deepCopy(obj, hash = new WeakMap()) {
          if (obj === null || typeof obj !== "object") {
            return obj; // Base case: primitives and null
          }
          if (obj instanceof Date) return new Date(obj);
          if (obj instanceof RegExp) return new RegExp(obj);

          // Check for circular references
          if (hash.has(obj)) {
            return hash.get(obj);
          }

          const cloned = new obj.constructor(); // Create a new object of the same type
          hash.set(obj, cloned); // Store the clone to handle circular references

          for (const key in obj) {
            if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key)) {
              cloned[key] = deepCopy(obj[key], hash); // Recursively copy each property
            }
          }

          return cloned;
        }
    ```

4. **Framework Related (Vue/React):**

    *   **Vue vs. React:** Snippet 9 mentions "the similarities and differences between Vue and React in terms of usage and implementation."  Be prepared to compare their component models, reactivity systems, and virtual DOM implementations.
    *   **Virtual DOM:** Snippet 9 also mentions "what is virtual DOM."  Understand how virtual DOM works, its benefits (performance optimization), and how it's used in frameworks like React and Vue.
    * **Vuex:** Snippet 8 asks "understanding of Vuex," suggesting knowledge of state management in Vue applications is important.
    * **Routing:** Snippet 8 mentions "two types of routing." Understand the differences and uses of hash-based and history-based routing.

5.  **Web Fundamentals:**

    *   **HTTP Caching:** Snippet 10 mentions "HTTP cache request and response headers."  Be prepared to discuss `Expires`, `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Last-Modified`, and how they relate to both forced caching (strong caching) and negotiated caching (validation caching).
    *   **Cross-Origin Issues:** Snippet 2 mentions "cross-origin solutions." Be familiar with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), JSONP, and other techniques for handling cross-origin requests.
    *   **Web Security:** Snippet 2 mentions "web security." Be prepared to discuss common web vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and how to prevent them.
    *   **SSL/TLS Encryption:** Snippet 2 mentions "SSL encryption process." Understand the basics of how SSL/TLS works to secure communication between a client and a server.

6. **Other Potential Coding Questions (Not explicitly in snippets but common):**

    *   **Implement `Promise.all`:**  This tests your understanding of Promise and asynchronous operations.
    *   **Implement `debounce` and `throttle`:** These are frequently asked in front-end interviews to assess your understanding of performance optimization techniques.
    *   **Event Delegation:** Implementing event delegation to handle events on multiple child elements efficiently.

**Key Takeaways and Preparation Tips:**

*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:**  The emphasis on "handwritten code" means you need to be comfortable writing code without the aid of an IDE or autocomplete.  Use a whiteboard or pen and paper to simulate the interview environment.
*   **Understand the "Why":**  Don't just memorize solutions.  Understand the underlying principles behind each concept and algorithm.  Be able to explain *why* your code works.
*   **Time and Space Complexity:**  For algorithm questions, be prepared to analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions.
*   **Clean Code:**  Write clean, well-structured, and readable code, even under pressure. Use meaningful variable names and add comments where necessary.
* **Think out loud**: Explain your thought process to the interviewer.

By focusing on these areas and practicing your coding skills, you'll be well-prepared for a ByteDance front-end interview. Good luck!
