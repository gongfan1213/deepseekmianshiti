Okay, I'll perform a new search and compile a list of ByteDance (TikTok/Douyin) front-end interview coding questions that require on-site, handwritten code, *strictly* avoiding any repetition from the previous responses. I'll focus on finding fresh examples and expanding into less commonly mentioned, but still relevant, areas. Since the prior responses covered a *lot* of ground, this will be a challenge, focusing on more nuanced or advanced problems.

**New Search & Compilation of *Non-Repeated* ByteDance Front-End Coding Questions:**

Because previous responses covered foundational JavaScript, core algorithms, and common framework questions, I'll focus this search on:

*   **More Advanced JavaScript Concepts:**  Deeper dives into less frequently tested areas.
*   **System Design-ish Coding:**  Front-end system design is becoming more common, so problems that blend coding with architectural thinking.
*   **Web Performance (with a coding component):**  Problems that require both understanding and code to improve performance.
*   **Less Common, but Practical, Algorithms:**  Things beyond the absolute basics.
*   **ByteDance/Douyin Specific:** If the search reveals problems tailored to their products.

**Here are some examples of questions and areas *not* covered previously, along with code where applicable:**

1.  **Advanced Asynchronous Patterns**

    *   **Problem:** Implement a function `retryPromise(promiseFn, maxRetries)` that takes a function `promiseFn` (which returns a promise) and a number `maxRetries`. The function should retry the promise up to `maxRetries` times if it rejects.  If it succeeds, resolve with the result. If it fails after all retries, reject with the final error.
    ```javascript
    function retryPromise(promiseFn, maxRetries) {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let attempts = 0;

        function attempt() {
          attempts++;
          promiseFn()
            .then(resolve)
            .catch((error) => {
              if (attempts >= maxRetries) {
                reject(error);
              } else {
                console.log(`Attempt ${attempts} failed, retrying...`);
                attempt(); // Recursive call for retry
              }
            });
        }

        attempt(); // Start the first attempt
      });
    }

    // Example Usage:
    let attemptCount = 0;
    const flakyPromise = () => {
      attemptCount++;
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (attemptCount < 3) {
          reject(new Error('Failed!'));
        } else {
          resolve('Success!');
        }
      });
    };

    retryPromise(flakyPromise, 5)
      .then(console.log) // Output: "Success!" (after 2 failed attempts)
      .catch(console.error);
    ```

2.  **Web Performance Optimization (Coding)**

    *   **Problem:** You have a webpage with a large number of images.  Implement a simple lazy loading mechanism *without* using a library.  Only load images when they are near the viewport.
        *   **Key Concepts:**  Intersection Observer API, `data-*` attributes.
        ```javascript
        // HTML (example):
        // <img data-src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        // <img data-src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
        // ...

        // JavaScript:
        function lazyLoadImages() {
          const images = document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]');

          const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
            (entries, observer) => {
              entries.forEach(entry => {
                if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                  const img = entry.target;
                  img.src = img.dataset.src; // Load the image
                  img.removeAttribute('data-src'); // Remove the data-src attribute
                  observer.unobserve(img); // Stop observing once loaded
                }
              });
            },
            {
              rootMargin: '100px 0px', // Load images 100px before they enter the viewport
            }
          );

          images.forEach(image => {
            observer.observe(image);
          });
        }

        // Call the function to initialize lazy loading
        lazyLoadImages();
        ```

3. **Mini-System Design (with Coding)**

    *   **Problem:**  Design and implement a simple, in-memory rate limiter for API requests. Assume you have a function `makeApiRequest()`.  The rate limiter should allow a maximum of `N` requests per `M` seconds.  If the rate limit is exceeded, subsequent calls to `makeApiRequest()` should be delayed (or rejected, depending on your design choice - clarify with the interviewer).
       ```javascript
        class RateLimiter {
          constructor(maxRequests, intervalMs) {
            this.maxRequests = maxRequests;
            this.intervalMs = intervalMs;
            this.requestTimestamps = [];
          }

          isAllowed() {
            const now = Date.now();
            this.requestTimestamps = this.requestTimestamps.filter(
              (timestamp) => now - timestamp <= this.intervalMs
            );
            return this.requestTimestamps.length < this.maxRequests;
          }
           // Option 1: Delaying requests using setTimeout
           async makeApiRequestWithDelay(apiFunction, ...args){
                while(!this.isAllowed()){
                    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, this.intervalMs/ this.maxRequests)); //simple delay
                }
                this.requestTimestamps.push(Date.now());
                return apiFunction(...args)
           }

          // Option 2:  Rejecting requests
          makeApiRequest(apiFunction, ...args) {
            if (this.isAllowed()) {
              this.requestTimestamps.push(Date.now());
              return apiFunction(...args);
            } else {
              return Promise.reject(new Error('Rate limit exceeded'));
            }
          }
        }

        // Example Usage:
        const limiter = new RateLimiter(5, 1000); // 5 requests per 1 second

        function mockApiRequest(id) {
          return new Promise((resolve) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
              console.log(`Request ${id} completed at ${Date.now()}`);
              resolve(id);
            }, 200); // Simulate some network latency
          });
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          limiter.makeApiRequest(mockApiRequest, i) //using rejecting requests method.
            .then((result) => {
              // Handle success
            })
            .catch((error) => {
              console.error(error.message); // Rate limit exceeded
            });
        }

       ```

4.  **Less Common, but Practical Algorithm**

    *   **Problem:** Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
        1.  Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
        2.  Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
        *   This is different from simply reversing a string or checking for palindromes, as it deals with *nested* structures.
    ```javascript
    function isValidParentheses(s) {
      const stack = [];
      const map = {
        ')': '(',
        '}': '{',
        ']': '[',
      };

      for (const char of s) {
        if (map[char]) {
          // Closing bracket
          if (stack.pop() !== map[char]) {
            return false; // Mismatched bracket
          }
        } else {
          // Opening bracket
          stack.push(char);
        }
      }

      return stack.length === 0; // Stack should be empty if all brackets are matched
    }
    ```

5. **String Manipulation (Advanced)**

    * **Problem**: Implement a function `findLongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters(s)` that finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string `s`.
    ```javascript
        function findLongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters(s) {
            let longest = 0;
            let start = 0;
            let seen = {}; //character -> index

            for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
                const char = s[i];
                if(seen[char] !== undefined && seen[char] >= start){
                    //repeated character within current window
                    start = seen[char] + 1;
                }
                seen[char] = i;
                longest = Math.max(longest, i - start + 1);
            }
            return longest;
        }
    ```

**Important Considerations for a ByteDance/Douyin Interview (Beyond the Code):**

*   **Communication:**  Even more important than getting the perfect solution is clearly explaining your thought process, assumptions, and trade-offs.  Talk through your approach *before* you start writing code.
*   **Edge Cases:**  Always consider edge cases and boundary conditions (empty inputs, invalid inputs, large inputs, etc.).  Ask clarifying questions if necessary.
*   **Optimization:**  Once you have a working solution, be prepared to discuss potential optimizations (time and space complexity).  The interviewer might ask, "Can you make this faster?" or "Can you use less memory?"
*   **Testing:** Mentally (or on the whiteboard) walk through your code with test cases, including edge cases.
* **ByteDance/Douyin Values:** Although not directly related to coding questions, be aware of ByteDance's values and company culture. Show enthusiasm for their products.

This list provides a set of *new* coding challenges that are more advanced and haven't been covered in the previous responses. It's crucial to practice these types of problems, focusing on clean, efficient, and well-explained code. Remember that the interviewer is evaluating not just your coding skills, but also your problem-solving approach, communication, and ability to think under pressure. Good luck!
