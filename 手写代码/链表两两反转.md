```javascript
function reversePairs(head) {
  if (!head || !head.next) {
    return head;
  }

  let newHead = head.next;
  let prev = null;
  let current = head;

  while (current && current.next) {
    let next = current.next;
    let temp = next.next;

    next.next = current;
    current.next = temp;

    if (prev) {
      prev.next = next;
    }

    prev = current;
    current = temp;
  }

  return newHead;
}


// Example usage:
// Create a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
const head = { val: 1, next: { val: 2, next: { val: 3, next: { val: 4, next: { val: 5, next: null } } } } };

const reversedList = reversePairs(head);

// Print the reversed list: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
let current = reversedList;
while (current) {
  console.log(current.val);
  current = current.next;
}

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Case:**  If the list is empty or has only one node, there's nothing to reverse. Return the head as is.

2. **New Head:** The second node becomes the new head of the list.

3. **Iteration:** The `while` loop continues as long as there are at least two nodes remaining (`current` and `current.next`).

4. **Swapping:** Inside the loop:
   - `next` stores the next node.
   - `temp` stores the node after `next` (to maintain the link to the rest of the list).
   - `next.next = current;` reverses the link between the current and next nodes.
   - `current.next = temp;` connects the current node to the rest of the list.

5. **Connecting Previous Pair:**  `if (prev)` checks if this isn't the first pair being reversed. If it's not the first pair, `prev.next = next;` connects the previous pair to the newly reversed pair.

6. **Updating Pointers:** `prev` becomes `current`, and `current` moves to `temp` to process the next pair.

7. **Return New Head:** Finally, the function returns `newHead`, which is the head of the reversed pairs list.


This code efficiently reverses the linked list in pairs by iterating through it once and manipulating the pointers.  It handles both even and odd length lists correctly.
